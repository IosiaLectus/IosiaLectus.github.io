My primary research interests are in applications of quantum information theory to quantum gravity, and I primarily work in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. My recent work has been focused on the holographic complexity proposals of Susskind et al., though I am also thinking about complexity in quantum field theory and ER=EPR. For more information about my publications, see my CV or inSPIRE profile (links above and below respectively).
