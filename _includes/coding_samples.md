Here are a few things I've done with code:

### Kaggle

I have participated in a few competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iosialectus), including the Titanic learning challenge (several times) and the Toxic Comments Classification Challenge by Jigsaw/Conversation AI. I have the latest iteration of my Titanic challenge code hosted on GitHub as a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/IosiaLectus/Titanic-on-Kaggle/blob/master/Titanic.ipynb).

### Pygame

After coming accross Al Swiegart's python books, I decided to play around a bit with Pygame. The result was a cellular automaton implementation. The git repo is hosted on github [here](https://github.com/IosiaLectus/CellularAutomata)

### Websites

I put together this website, as well as my [wedding website](kimgetsacouch.com), using Jekyll and templates from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp), as well as [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp). The source for these websites can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/IosiaLectus/iosialectus.github.io) and [here](https://github.com/IosiaLectus/kimgetsacouch).

### Javascript

I spent some time once playing around with javascript, reimplementing a cellular automaton, which defaults to Conway's game of life. A live demo can be found [here](josiahcouch.com/playingwithjavascript), and the github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/IosiaLectus/playingwithjavascript)
