Hi, my name is Josiah Couch. I am studying physics with the [Weinberg Theory Group](https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/) in the [Department of Physics](https://www.ph.utexas.edu) at the University of Texas at Austin. I have had a lifelong fascination with systems and ideas which has led to a broad range of interests, especially in science, programming, and languages, as well as my decision to study theoretical physics. As a student in the theory group I study the intersection of quantum information and quantum gravity in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
