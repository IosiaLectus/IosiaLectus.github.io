Hi, my name is Josiah Couch. I am studying physics with the [Weinberg Theory Group](https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/) in the [Department of Physics](https://www.ph.utexas.edu) at the University of Texas at Austin. I have had a lifelong fascination with science, mathematics, and technology, which has culminated my decision to study theoretical physics. As a student in the theory group I study the intersection of quantum information and quantum gravity in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. As somewhat nerdy layperson I am broadly interested in a variety of topics in science and technology and beyond, including quantum computing, autonomous vehicles, machine learning, functional programming, blockchain, synthetic biology, phylogenetics, neuroscience, languages, and historical linguistics.
