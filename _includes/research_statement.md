My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of quantum gravity and quantum information. While I am quite broadly interested in this intersection, my research so far has largely focused on extended black hole thermodynamics and a set of conjectures which go under the moniker of 'holographic complexity.' More recently I've also done some work related to the scrambling of information in AdS/CFT (and more generally). In the future I would like explore a number of topics, including tensor networks, quantum error correcting codes, and the emergence of spacetime in holography.

### Spacetime Theromodynamics

My work in AdS/CFT started by exploring so called extended black hole (or more genrally spacetime) thermodynamics, sometimes referred to as black hole chemistry.  

### Holographic complexity

Researchers at Stanford and later elsewhere have put forward a family of conjectures that within the AdS/CFT correspondence, certain bulk quantities, most notable the action on Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) patch (which, if one ignores reflecting boundry conditions, is the causal development of a bulk spatial slice bounded by some chosen slice at infinity) are dual to the *circuit complexity* of the dual state, i.e. to the minimum number of quantum gates needed to prepare the boundary state from some given reference state. These conjectures leave many questions unanswered, such as what complexity are we talking about (i.e., which are the allowed gates and what is the reference state), but there are none the less a few qualitative arguments in their favor.

My work on holographic complexity began when my collaborators and I noticed that the rate of change of the action of the WDW patch for certain black holes can be broken down into pieces which are each given by some thermodynamic variables in conjugate pairs. One piece in particular is equal to the thermodynamic volume times the 'pressure' due to the cosmological constant. This led us to ask whether there is a relationship between complexity and extended thermodynamics.

### Other Interests

In addition to the above, I have been working recently on understanding the relationships between various velocity scales involved in the scrambling of quantum information ...

I am also in the early stages of thinking about ways to extend the recently published results of Jacobson and Visser on the thermodynamics of finite causal diamonds ...
