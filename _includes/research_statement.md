My research has so far been focused on the holographic complexity proposals of Susskind et al., though I am broadly interested in the intersection of gravity, quantum field theory, and quantum information. My previous work, as indicated below by my publications and talks, has looked at possible links between holographic complexity and the extended black hole thermodynamics, at holographic complexity in non-commutative gauge theories, and in general properties of the 'complexity = volume' conjecture. My current work is largely focused on subregion complexity in holography and mixed state complexity in field theory. I am also thinking about traversable wormholes and complexity in non-local field theory.

The holographic complexity proposals ...

### Spacetime Theromodynamics

My original interest holographic complexity was as a means to understand extended black hole thermodynamics in AdS.
