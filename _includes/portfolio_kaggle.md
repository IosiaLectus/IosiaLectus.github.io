I have attempted a couple of the competitions at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Titanic Challenge

I have solved the Titanic challenge a number of times. The first time, I used my own implementation of the perceptron algorithm, whose source code can be found [here](https://github.com/IosiaLectus/Perceptron). Subsequent times i have used built in implementations of algorithms from Scikit-Learn. A Jupyter notebook representing my most mature solution to the Titanic Challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/IosiaLectus/Titanic-on-Kaggle/blob/master/Titanic.ipynb).

## Toxic Comments

I also participated (with teammates) in the Toxic Comments competition.
