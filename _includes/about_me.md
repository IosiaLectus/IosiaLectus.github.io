## About Me

Hi, my name is Josiah Couch. I am studying physics with the [Weinberg Theory Group](https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/) in the [Department of Physics](https://www.ph.utexas.edu) at the University of Texas at Austin. At UT I think about the AdS/CFT correspondence and generally also work as a TA. Outside of UT, I enjoy trying new foods, posting photos to Instagram, and reading as well as talking about science and technology.
