## About Me  

I am finishing my Ph.D. in physics with the [Weinberg Theory Group](https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/) in the [Department of Physics](https://www.ph.utexas.edu) at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on quantum field theory and quantum gravity and their intersection with quantum information.
